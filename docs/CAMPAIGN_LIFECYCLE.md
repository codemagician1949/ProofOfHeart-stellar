# Campaign Lifecycle

## States

```
Created → Active → Verified (optional) → Withdrawn (goal met)
                                           → Refunded (goal not met / cancelled)
```

A campaign progresses through the following states:

1. **Created** — After `create_campaign()`. Starts active.
2. **Active** — Accepting contributions until the deadline.
3. **Verified** — (Optional) Admin `verify_campaign()` or community `verify_campaign_with_votes()`.
4. **Withdrawn** — Creator calls `withdraw_funds()` after `amount_raised >= funding_goal`. Campaign becomes inactive.
5. **Cancelled** — Creator calls `cancel_campaign()`. Campaign becomes inactive; contributors can `claim_refund()`.
6. **Expired** — Deadline passes without meeting the goal. Contributors can `claim_refund()`.

## Pause Mechanism

The contract has two independent pause flags:

### Manual Pause (`DataKey::Paused`)

- Set by admin via `pause()`.
- Cleared by admin via `unpause()`.
- Emits `contract_paused` / `contract_unpaused`.

### Auto-Pause (`DataKey::AutoPaused`)

Automatically set on either of two anomaly triggers during `contribute()`:

- **Huge contribution** — A single contribution exceeds 200% of the campaign's `funding_goal` (`amount * 10000 > funding_goal * 20000`). Emits `("auto_paused",)` with `("huge_contribution", amount)`.
- **Burst** — More than 10 contributions to the same campaign in a single ledger (block). Emits `("auto_paused",)` with `("burst", block_count)`.

In both cases the contribution is rejected (`ContractPaused` error) and the storage write is rolled back, so `AutoPaused` never persists in production — the flag is always cleared on the next successful call. This caveat is important for indexers.

- Blocks all state-changing operations (same as manual pause).
- Cleared by:
  - **`unpause()`** — Admin can always clear the auto-pause flag, even if the triggering campaign is no longer active.
  - **`resume_campaign(campaign_id)`** — Admin clears the flag, but only if the referenced campaign is still active (not cancelled/expired).

### Why two flags?

Using separate flags provides a clearer audit trail — indexers can distinguish between an admin-initiated pause and an automatic safety pause. The admin can always recover the contract via `unpause()`, even when `resume_campaign()` is blocked (e.g., the triggering campaign was cancelled).

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Recovery |
|----------|----------|
| Burst contribution triggers auto-pause; campaign is still active | `resume_campaign(campaign_id)` or `unpause()` |
| Burst contribution triggers auto-pause; campaign was cancelled | `unpause()` only (`resume_campaign` fails with `CampaignNotActive`) |
| Admin pauses manually | `unpause()` |
# Campaign Lifecycle (State Machine)

Campaigns are represented by a `Campaign` struct with these key state flags:

- `is_active`: whether the campaign is accepting actions as "open"
- `is_cancelled`: whether the creator has cancelled the campaign
- `funds_withdrawn`: whether the creator has withdrawn raised funds
- `is_verified`: whether the campaign has been verified (admin or community vote)

Additional derived conditions used by the contract:

- **Funded**: `amount_raised >= funding_goal`
- **Expired/Failed**: `ledger.timestamp() > deadline && amount_raised < funding_goal`

## States

### 1) Active (unverified)

- Set on `create_campaign`: `is_active = true`, `is_cancelled = false`, `funds_withdrawn = false`, `is_verified = false`.
- Contributions are blocked until verified: `contribute` returns `CampaignNotVerified` while `is_verified = false`.
- Creator can still update/cancel while active (subject to each method's rules).
- Full `update_campaign` edits are only available before verification and before any contributions.

### 2) Active + Verified

- Reached by either:
  - `verify_campaign` (admin verification), or
  - `verify_campaign_with_votes` (community verification after quorum + threshold).
- Once verified, contributions are allowed until the deadline, as long as `is_active = true` and `is_cancelled = false`.
- Re-verification errors are intentionally path-specific: `verify_campaign` returns `AdminVerificationConflict` and `verify_campaign_with_votes` returns `CommunityVerificationConflict` when the campaign is already verified. Voting on an already verified campaign still returns `CampaignAlreadyVerified`.
- **Verification freezes title and description** (issue #416): once `is_verified = true`, `update_campaign` returns `CampaignAlreadyVerified`. This prevents a creator from swapping campaign content after a verifier has approved the original content. `update_campaign_description` remains available after verification (it is intended for ongoing operational updates, not content changes).

### 3) Funded (derived)

- When `amount_raised >= funding_goal`, the campaign is considered funded.
- The contract does not set a dedicated boolean for "funded"; it is checked when withdrawing.
- The creator may call `withdraw_funds` once funded (and if not cancelled / not previously withdrawn).

### 4) Withdrawn / Closed

- Reached by `withdraw_funds`:
  - sets `funds_withdrawn = true`
  - sets `is_active = false`
- After this point:
  - `withdraw_funds` is blocked by `FundsAlreadyWithdrawn`
  - `cancel_campaign` is blocked by `CancellationNotAllowed`

### 5) Cancelled

- Reached by `cancel_campaign` (creator only):
  - sets `is_cancelled = true`
  - sets `is_active = false`
- Contributors can claim refunds via `claim_refund` after cancellation (if they contributed).
- Successful refunds remove the contributor's stored contribution record instead of leaving a zero-value entry behind.
- Refunds also reduce the campaign's live contribution denominator used for revenue sharing, ensuring remaining contributors receive the correct pro-rata share of future revenue claims.

### 6) Expired / Failed (derived)

- If the deadline passes and the campaign did not reach its goal (`Expired/Failed` derived condition), contributors can claim refunds via `claim_refund`.
- The contract does not currently toggle `is_active` automatically when a deadline passes; "expired" is computed at call time using the ledger timestamp.

## Token Migration Policy (issue #407)

The contract supports a two-step token migration via `propose_token_update` (7-day delay) followed by `accept_token_update`. To prevent stranding escrowed campaign balances in the old token:

- `accept_token_update` **refuses** to switch the accepted token while `ActiveCampaignCount > 0`.
- All campaigns must reach a **terminal state** (funds withdrawn via `withdraw_funds`, or cancelled via `cancel_campaign`) before the token address can be changed.
- Campaigns that have been cancelled but still have pending contributor refunds are counted as terminal (cancelled state is set before refunds are claimed), so contributors must claim their refunds in the old token before or after the migration.

**Implications for operators:**
1. Drain or cancel all active campaigns before proposing a token migration.
2. After all campaigns are in a terminal state, the 7-day delay must still elapse before `accept_token_update` can be called.
3. If a new campaign is created during the 7-day window, `accept_token_update` will reject the swap and the admin must cancel the pending update and repeat the process.
